Computers are now used widely in nearly everything today, from fast food restaurants to hospitals to the home. They can take the form of a personal computer, but can also be found in cars and ATMs. But how do they work? Well, there are several components that are integral to a working computer. These include the central processing unit, the motherboard, the graphics processing unit, and random access memory. Yet there’s also the operating system, storage, the power supply unit, the cooling system, and the case; and that’s not including any input or output devices like the monitor, mouse, or keyboard!
First, what exactly does the central processing unit, or CPU do? It’s often mentioned as the brain of the computer. The word “computer” comes from “compute”, so it’s easy to connect “computer” with a device that calculates numbers. And that’s basically what the CPU does. It executes program instructions by orchestrating other parts of the computer and by performing arithmetic and logical operations. Two main developers of these microprocessors for computers are Intel and AMD, while ARM develops CPUs for many mobile devices.
Next, RAM is vital in this step to store the instructions and data so that the CPU can quickly access it, while hard drives and solid state drives are repositories for long term data like videos and other files. RAM stands for random access memory, because it gets erased once the power is turned off. Not everyone knows the difference between hard drives and solid state drives, but the main distinction is that hard drives have moving parts while solid state drives, or SSDs, don’t.  SSDs are faster, but more expensive, while bigger hard drives can bought for less. And the graphics processing unit, or GPU, functions just like the CPU, except it’s specifically for rendering images and video so that something shows up on the screen. 
Meanwhile, the motherboard can be thought of as the foundation of the computer, because it channels power to all the components and connects them to each other. To actually run the computer, the power supply unit is essential in transferring electricity from the wall outlet to the computer. Additionally, the cooling system removes heat produced by the CPU, and other components to prevent them from malfunctioning. Types of cooling include heatsinks, computer fans, and even liquid cooling systems. Finally, the operating system is what actually takes all the components together and puts them to work. It’s the go-between for the programs and the hardware. Popular options are Apple’s macOS, Microsoft’s Windows, and open source Linux operating systems, which are free.
Desktop computers are the choice for many tasks, from writing a report for school to keeping track of money in a bank. For people to be able to use them well, several additional devices are required. These include a keyboard, mouse, and a monitor. Keyboards and mice plug in to USB ports on the computer, which are part of USB expansion cards. Expansion cards plug into expansion slots on the motherboard to add extra functions to the computer. Another example of an expansion card is a network card, which helps the computer to connect to the Internet. And head phone and microphone jacks on sound cards allow users to be able to connect speakers or a microphone. 
To recap, a computer is made up of many parts, the most basic of which are the CPU, RAM, GPU, the hard drive or solid state drive, and the motherboard. But other things are critical as well. An operating system connects hardware and software so that programs and apps can run. And it would be difficult to do anything without a screen or a mouse, or a keyboard. These devices, and others, can be added to a computer using expansion cards. With these, a computer is fully functional!
